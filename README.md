# Tech Market Demand Analyzer (Python)

## Project Overview

This project is an **async web scraping & data analysis pipeline** that collects Python-related job vacancies from public job boards and analyzes the **most demanded technologies on the tech market**.

The main goal is to help developers:

* understand which technologies are currently in demand
* compare requirements for **Junior / Middle / Senior** positions
* observe technology trends based on real job market data

The project intentionally separates **Scraping** and **Analysis** logic, following SRP and clean architecture principles.

* **Work.ua** – provides structured technology lists
* **DOU.ua** – provides unstructured job descriptions

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Only public data is scraped. No authentication, private data, or restricted content is accessed.
